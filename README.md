# VoidTeleport

VoidTeleport is a small and lightweight way to customize the void
on your Minecraft server. It provides a neat way to configure void-related
actions, allowing you to add and configure as many worlds as you want.

## Features

1. You can change the y-level which marks the start of the void.
2. You can choose whether to kill the player on contact, or to
   teleport them to a specified location.
3. You can change the teleport location.
4. You can add as many worlds as you would like.

All of this is changeable in the config file.

## How it Works

VoidTeleport uses ProtocolLib to directly look for the player's
movement packet
